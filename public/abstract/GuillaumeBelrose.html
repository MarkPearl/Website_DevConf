	<p>Testing is important, but I am lazy.</p>

	<p>In this talk, I will show how to leverage types (as in statically typed languages) so you can prevent certain types of bugs from occurring in the 1st place. It is about how to use the machinery of the compiler to check that your code is sound (and therefore does not need to be tested by traditional unit test approaches). I will also talk about property-based testing, or how you can use tools to automatically generate vast amounts of test cases so that you don't have to. </p>

	<p>Some tools are clever enough to hone on the particular test case that result in failure (the one that you have to fix). I will use Scala as a vehicle for demonstration, but the principles have been applied successfully to many other languages.</p>
